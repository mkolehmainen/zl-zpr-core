        // There are two types of resources these I/O routines contend for:
        // packet buffers, and system I/O output queues.
        //
        // Memory is cheap, so we solve the problem of packet buffer
        // contention simply by making sure there are at least as many
        // packet buffers existing as there can be outstanding.
        //
        // Packet buffers can be outstanding only while they are queued for
        // egress.  Buffers holding non-priority packets, as produced by the
        // Requeue, Substrate, Tun, and (possibly) MgmtSubstrate I/O
        // routines, are recovered at the end of every I/O cycle.
        // Therefore, it is sufficient that we have a number of packet
        // buffers available equal to the sum of the batch sizes for these
        // four paths.
        //
        // Buffers holding priority packets however are only recovered on
        // successful submission of the packet to the OS.  Though we do not
        // care if these starve non-priority paths, we do care that said
        // paths are starved of buffers fairly.  It suffices that we reserve
        // an additional number of packet buffers (beyond those already
        // reserved on behalf of MgmtSubstrate, the only source of priority
        // packets) equal to the batch size, corresponding to those priority
        // packets which were held from the last cycle.  (If priority
        // packets are held for two cycles, this implies that we are not
        // sending any non-priority packets and thus dropping them.)
        //
        // These buffer count requirements are enforced by the assert at the
        // top of this function.
        //
        // Regarding contention for system I/O output queues.  Only packets
        // from Substrate and Tun will ever be high enough rate to actually
        // matter.  So we statically give priority to packets Requeue and
        // MgmtSubstrate packets (the latter of which are almost certainly
        // actually marked as such).  For packets from Substrate and Tun, we
        // consider separately the adapter and node cases.
        //
        // On the adapter, traffic from Substrate always flows out the Tun
        // interface, and vice-versa.  So there is no contention between these
        // for the system I/O output queues.
        //
        // On the node, traffic to or from the Tun is management (typically
        // Visa-related) traffic, and thus typically lower rate than traffic
        // which only transits the Substrate, and also more important.  So
        // we can safely statically prioritize this traffic, which also
        // ensures that it doesn't get starved.
